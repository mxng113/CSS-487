# REAL-TIME FACE DETECTION AND OVERLAY EFFECTS
## Final group project for Computer Vision course at UW Bothell

With the rise of photo and video sharing social networking services, face detection has become one of the most popular and fastest growing fields in computer vision. Following the quarantine restriction in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the emergence of teleconference applications, such as Zoom, has motivated our group to dive into the concepts of face detection and augmented-reality filters for our final project. <br/>

Utiliziing computer vision concepts and the OpenCV library, this project is our attempt to build a program that accesses the userâ€™s webcam to implement face detections, then allows users to interact with the GUI to add Snapchat-like filters along with a background overlay in real-time. <br/>

Feel free to take a look at the project write-up pdf file for details on implementations as well as challenges.
